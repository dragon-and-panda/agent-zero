# Live Meeting Feature – Ad Storyboard

Purpose: provide a shot-by-shot plan for a 60-second promo showcasing the multi-agent Zoom-like meeting room. Each frame indicates visuals, VO/dialogue, and on-screen copy so the creative team can produce a polished ad or teaser.

## Scene 2 – “Meet the Team”
- **Visual:** Grid of animated tiles featuring the human seller plus agents: Portfolio Navigator, Vision Stylist, Copywriter, Buyer Liaison. Each tile shows live waveform + model badge.

- **VO/Copy:** “Ideas, data, and negotiations converge on a single canvas.”

## Scene 4 – “Instant Decisions”

- **VO/Copy:** “Conversations flow straight from the room to every marketplace.”

## Scene 6 – “Outro”
- **Visual:** Meeting ends with a glowing “Summary Ready” card; background transitions to brand lockup.

### Production Notes
- **Design Language:** Mirror the Mission Control UI (dark glass panels, neon accents).
- **Motion:** Use parallax transitions between dashboard and meeting room, subtle particle effects around agents when speaking.
- **Audio:** Soft ambient score with rising intensity; mix VO with text-to-speech snippets for agent voices.
- **Runtime:** ~60 seconds with 8–9 second beats per scene.

This storyboard can be passed to the creative team to build the ad, demo video, or interactive teaser for launches and social campaigns.
