# Autonomous Listing Service – Technical Blueprint

This document describes the design of an AI-native service that turns a seller’s raw photos and notes into premium listings, syndicates them across major marketplaces (Craigslist, Mercari, Nextdoor, etc.), and provides a unified conversational interface for negotiating with buyers. The system is intentionally agentic, multi-LLM, and RAG-enabled while running on a lightweight Python container suitable for serverless deployments.

---

## 1. Goals & Constraints
- **Delightful Listings:** Transform mediocre images + short descriptions into polished media and persuasive narratives that boost conversions.
- **One-Click Syndication:** Publish consistently formatted listings to multiple platforms with per-channel compliance.
- **Unified Messaging:** Give sellers a Zoom-like conversational hub to coordinate with AI agents and buyers while listings are live.
- **Autonomous Lifecycle:** Monitor inquiries, negotiate within guardrails, and auto-close listings once an item sells.
- **Portable Runtime:** Deliver as a Python-first, containerized micro-app deployable on Lambda, Cloud Run, or Fargate.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```
User → Web/App UI → API Gateway → Python Orchestrator (FastAPI) → Agent Mesh
                                                ↘ Event Bus / Task Queue
                                                  ↘ Worker Pods (image, LLM, RAG, integrators)
Storage Layers: Object storage (images), Vector DB (descriptions/market data), Relational DB (listings, chats)
```

### Core Services
1. **Ingestion & Auth**
   - Accepts photo uploads, metadata, and voice/text notes.
   - Performs safe content checks before processing.
2. **AI Creativity Pipeline**
   - Image Enhancement Agent: Upscales, denoises, applies lighting corrections, and composes collage thumbnails.
   - Styling Agent: Suggests background removal or contextual scenes (e.g., staging furniture).
   - Narrative Agent: Generates long-form descriptions leveraging a marketing RAG corpus + sentiment tuning for each marketplace.
3. **Marketplace Integrators**
   - Channel-specific adapters for Craigslist, Mercari, Nextdoor, (extensible to Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, etc.).
   - Normalizes categories, pricing, shipping, and handles platform-specific throttling/anti-bot rules.
4. **Engagement Hub**
   - Real-time messaging service bridging buyers (email/SMS/in-platform chat) with seller + negotiation agents.
   - Shared timeline UI showing offers, counteroffers, and status changes.
5. **Lifecycle Controller**
   - Tracks listing states (draft → scheduled → live → pending sale → closed).
   - Automatically unlists from all channels once a purchase is confirmed.

## 3. Agentic Workflow

| Step | Agent | Description | LLM Model(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intake | Concierge Agent | Confirms item details, requests missing info, runs safety checklist. | GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet |
| Visual Polish | Vision Stylist & Enhancer | Applies upscaling, background cleanup, style transfer tuned per category. | Stable Diffusion XL / ControlNet + DeepSeek-VL for QA |
| Narrative Crafting | Listing Copywriter | Generates short + long descriptions, bullet highlights, SEO tags, shipping guidance. Uses RAG on market best practices. | GPT-4.1 / Gemini 1.5 Pro |
| Valuation | Pricing Analyst | Benchmarks with comps fetched via search APIs; suggests optimal price tiers. | Claude 3.5 Haiku + internal comps DB |
| Syndication | Channel Publisher | Maps listing to each platform’s schema, posts, and verifies success. | Tool-executing agent via FastAPI + Selenium/API |
| Engagement | Buyer Liaison | Monitors inquiries, drafts responses, escalates to seller when negotiation boundaries hit. | GPT-4o mini (fast) with guardrails |
| Closure | Lifecycle Steward | Detects sale confirmation, auto-closes all channels, generates pick-up instructions. | Rule-based + LLM verification |

Agents communicate via the existing `call_subordinate` + `knowledge_tool` primitives, storing context in `memory`/`knowledge` for reuse (e.g., pricing heuristics, category guidelines).

## 4. AI Pipeline Details

### 4.1 Image Enhancement
- **Stages:** (1) quality assessment → (2) super-resolution (e.g., Real-ESRGAN) → (3) background cleanup (Matte-ing) → (4) lighting & color grading → (5) layout collage.
- **Outputs:** hero image, 3–5 gallery shots, detail zooms, and optional lifestyle composite scene.
- **Instrumentation:** Each step logs metrics (sharpness delta, noise reduction) for future fine-tuning.

### 4.2 Description + Sentiment Crafting
- **Inputs:** Seller notes, extracted metadata (dimensions via OCR, brand logos, etc.), prior sales comps.
- **RAG Sources:** Marketing playbooks, brand tone guides, compliance docs per platform.
- **Outputs:** 
  - Title optimized for SEO,
  - Rich paragraph + bullet list,
  - Condition disclosures,
  - Suggested hashtags and shipping/pickup text.
- **Tone Tuning:** Different prompt templates per platform (e.g., concise for Craigslist, lifestyle-forward for Nextdoor).

### 4.3 Pricing & Strategy
- Pulls live comps via aggregator APIs (where permitted) or stored datasets.
- Generates price ladder (list price, “fast-sale” price, minimum acceptable).
- Feeds guardrails to Buyer Liaison (auto-approve offers above threshold, escalate otherwise).

---

## 5. Marketplace Integrations

| Platform | Integration Mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Craigslist | Headless browser automation (Playwright) + email relay for replies. | Needs CAPTCHA-solving strategy (vision model + manual fallback). |
| Mercari | Official API (if available) or mobile-app automation. | Supports shipping label creation; track order IDs. |
| Nextdoor | Web automation w/ community selection. | Monitor community guidelines to avoid spam flags. |
| Custom / Others | Modular adapters via interface `MarketplacePublisher`. | Easy to add OfferUp, eBay, Etsy later. |

Failure handling: retries with exponential backoff, webhook-like callbacks to update listing state, and anomaly logging for manual review.

---

## 6. Unified Seller Interface

### UX Tenets
- **Organic Flow:** Minimal forms; conversational onboarding with dynamic checklists.
- **Zoom-like Collab:** Agents appear as avatars, announce actions (e.g., “Copywriter drafting Mercari description”). Seller can join live huddles to approve or tweak content.
- **Inbox View:** Threaded conversations grouped by platform and buyer; AI-suggested replies with quick-edit controls.
- **Visual Dashboard:** Pipeline status (Processing Images → Drafting → Live on X platforms), price ladder, performance analytics.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js or SvelteKit with WebSockets for live updates.
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI orchestrator running inside a slim container (e.g., distroless + uvicorn). Event-driven tasks handled by Celery/Redis or AWS SQS + Lambda workers.
- **Storage:** 
  - S3-compatible bucket for assets,
  - Postgres for listings/offers,
  - Redis/WebSocket gateway for live messaging,
  - Vector DB (Qdrant/Pinecone) for RAG corpora.

## 7. Serverless / Containerized Deployment

| Layer | Option | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API + UI | AWS Lambda (FastAPI via Mangum) or Cloud Run | Handles synchronous interactions. |
| Workers | AWS Fargate / ECS tasks or Cloud Run Jobs | For heavier image/LLM workloads. |
| Event Bus | AWS SQS + EventBridge or Pub/Sub | Decouples ingestion from processing. |
| Media Processing | AWS Lambda w/ GPU (if available) or attached GPU service | For rapid diffusion-based adjustments. |

CI/CD builds a single container image (FastAPI + worker binaries) pushed to ECR/GCR. Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/Pulumi) provisions queues, storage, and secrets.

---

## 8. Data & Knowledge Fabric
- **Knowledge Packs:** 
  - Marketing best practices,
  - Platform policy summaries (`knowledge/custom/main/policies/*.md`),
  - Visual staging tips per category,
  - Voice/tone guide + SOP excerpt automatically ingested by `KnowledgeBase` and injected into prompts/compliance checks.
- **RAG Pipeline:** 
  1. Seller intent + item metadata → embed → retrieve from vector DB + local knowledge pack,
  2. Feed retrieved snippets into Copywriter prompts (`DescriptionGenerator` now consumes `KnowledgeBase` excerpts),
  3. Store resulting listing in `memory/solutions` for future reuse.
- **Compliance Guard:** `ComplianceChecker` references the same policy pack to flag banned phrases, missing pickup disclosures, or marketplace-specific gaps before publishing.
- **Personalization:** Seller preferences (tone, negotiation style) saved to memory and loaded automatically when they return.

---

## 10. Future Enhancements
- **Smart Negotiation:** Reinforcement-learning agent tuned on successful deal histories.
- **Buyer Discovery:** Cross-post to social channels with auto-generated reels/stories.
- **Shipment Automation:** Integration with UPS/FedEx APIs for instant label creation.
- **Reputation Engine:** Aggregate feedback across platforms to build seller trust profiles.
- **Predictive Demand:** Recommend best posting windows and price adjustments based on market trends.

---

## 11. Co-Development with the Super Agency

- **Mission Diary:** Maintain `docs/programs/autonomous_listing/journal.md` logging every experiment, release, and KPI shift so agents can learn from prior iterations.
- **Improvement Backlog:** Share a prioritized list (`docs/programs/autonomous_listing/improvements.md`) that feeds into the agency-wide iterative protocol (see Section 15 of `autonomous_super_agency.md`).
- **Telemetry Handoff:** Telemetry Sentinel publishes listing-service-specific health reports (conversion uplift, response latency, negotiation success rate) for Portfolio Navigator to review weekly.
- **Prompt Sync:** Copywriter, Buyer Liaison, and Publisher persona prompts live under `prompts/super-agency/roles/listing_*` and reference the same change log as the broader agency to keep behavior updates auditable.
- **Feedback Routing:** Any seller or buyer feedback entering the Engagement Hub is tagged and stored in `knowledge/custom/main/listings/` so the RAG corpus continuously reflects real-world voice-of-customer insights.
- **Release Ritual:** Every deployment of the service includes a short “What changed / Metrics impacted / Next bet” record appended to the mission diary, ensuring synchronous evolution of the agency and this product line.

This blueprint provides a detailed path to a serverless, AI-native listing concierge that delights sellers and scales across marketplaces with minimal manual effort.

---

## 12. Engagement Hub Blueprint
- **Escalation Hooks:** When offers breach guardrails or sentiment turns toxic, hub emits `engagement.escalation` telemetry events and pings Apex Orchestrator per Section 15 of the super-agency doc.
- **Next Steps:** Implement `/ws` endpoint + minimal frontend widget, log all interactions to `logs/engagement/<listing>.json`, and integrate transcripts into mission diary/RAG corpus for future negotiation improvements.

---

## 13. Dropshipping Integration Path

1. **Inventory & Supplier Data**
   - Add a dropship catalog store (e.g., Postgres + supplier APIs) with SKU metadata, realtime stock, shipping SLAs, and wholesale costs.
   - Extend `ListingRequest` schema to accept SKU references, supplier priorities, and fulfillment rules.
2. **Fulfillment Agent**
   - New “Logistics Orchestrator” agent monitors orders/reservations, selects best supplier based on stock, shipping region, margin, and reliability.
   - Integrate with fulfillment APIs (ShipBob, Printful, custom warehouses) to create shipments, retrieve tracking, and feed status back into lifecycle controller.
3. **Pricing & Margin Controls**
   - Pricing Analyst references wholesale cost + shipping to compute margin ladder; guardrails ensure negotiation agent never dips below margin floor.
4. **Customer-Facing Updates**
   - Engagement Hub displays fulfillment timeline, estimated delivery, and tracking actions.
   - Listings automatically include shipping methods/timeframes derived from supplier metadata.
5. **Telemetry & Compliance**
   - Add telemetry events (`dropship.order_created`, `dropship.fulfilled`, `dropship.delay_alert`) for Operations team.
   - Ensure policy packs cover supplier SLAs, returns workflow, and marketplace compliance (e.g., clearly tagging dropshipped items when required).

This roadmap lets the autonomous agency operate first-party listings and a dropshipping catalog within the same pipelines, leveraging existing negotiation, marketplace, and lifecycle components.

- **Messaging Broker:** FastAPI sub-app using WebSockets (or Socket.IO) with Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling. Endpoint: `/ws/listings/{listing_id}` authenticates sellers + agents, streams buyer inquiries, AI suggestions, and manual replies.
- **AI Reply Assist:** Buyer Liaison agent listens to inbound messages, runs intent classification + guardrail checks, drafts replies via LLM client, and queues them for human approval or auto-send when confidence > threshold.
- **UI Stub:** React panel with three columns: contact list (buyers per platform), conversation thread (with AI-suggested replies chips), and negotiation guardrail meter showing remaining discount budget.
- **Escalation Hooks:** When offers breach guardrails or sentiment turns toxic, hub emits `engagement.escalation` telemetry events and pings Apex Orchestrator per Section 15 of the super-agency doc.
- **Next Steps:** Implement `/ws` endpoint + minimal frontend widget, log all interactions to `logs/engagement/<listing>.json`, and integrate transcripts into mission diary/RAG corpus for future negotiation improvements.
