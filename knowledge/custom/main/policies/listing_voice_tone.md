# Listing Voice & Tone Guide

Use this when generating copy or responding to buyers. It keeps messaging consistent across platforms while allowing persona-specific nuance.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity over fluff:** Lead with the primary buyer benefit within the first 30 words.
- **Evidence-backed claims:** Reference concrete specs, usage history, or maintenance records instead of vague superlatives.
- **Trust anchors:** Mention warranties, original receipts, or seller reputation if available. When absent, emphasize transparent condition reporting.
- **Actionable next steps:** Close every listing with a clear call to action ("Message for porch pickup", "Book Mercari shipping label").

## Tone Tracks
| Scenario | Tone | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Premium / collector items | Confident, polished | Highlight provenance, rarity, included accessories. Use complete sentences, avoid emojis. |
| Everyday household goods | Warm, practical | Focus on how the item solves daily friction. Light emoji allowed (Nextdoor only). |
| Fast-moving tech / gadgets | Energetic, data-driven | List key specs in bullets, mention benchmarks or app compatibility. |
| Furniture / bulky items | Reassuring, logistical | Include measurements, weight, transport tips, and suggestions for pickup. |

## Compliance Hooks
- Reiterate condition using marketplace vocabulary ("Like New", "Good", etc.).
- Disclose cosmetic blemishes proactively to reduce returns.
- For refurbished/custom items, state the technician or process involved.
- Avoid "guarantees" unless backed by seller policy; use "tested", "verified", "works as expected" instead.

## CTA Patterns
- Craigslist: "Cash or verified digital payment at pickup. Reply via Craigslist relay to schedule." 
- Mercari: "Tap 'Buy Now' for insured shipping; I ship within 24h." 
- Nextdoor: "DM to arrange a porch pickup or meet at the community center." 

## Buyer Engagement Snippets
- **Interest acknowledgement:** "Thanks for reaching out! Happy to answer anything you need about the [item]."
- **Price counter template:** "Appreciate the offer. Based on comparable sales and condition, I can meet you at $X if pickup happens this week."
- **Hold policy:** "I can hold it for 12 hours once we agree on price. After that it returns to active status so everyone stays informed."
- **Safety reminder:** "For both of us, let's meet at [public spot]/use the built-in payment protection."
