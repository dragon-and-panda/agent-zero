# Super-Agency Prompt Changelog

## 2025-12-10
- Initial duplication from `prompts/default`.
- Added Apex Orchestrator-centered role guidance plus Persona Library (Apex Orchestrator, Portfolio Navigator, Risk & Ethics Governor, Research Studio Director, Research Fellow, Product Synthesist, Platform Engineering Director, Telemetry Sentinel, Autonomy Comptroller, Listing Publisher).
- Wired `agent.system.main.md` to include the persona snippets so downstream agents inherit the same canon.
